# About

The rise of international players in the NBA has been widely noted. Recent MVP awards (Jokic '21 & '22, Giannis '19 & '20) reflect the increase in international superstars. [Plenty of people have noticed](https://www.nba.com/news/international-big-men-rule-nba-with-their-all-around-skills) that the increase seems to be more pronounced for big men than for other positions, so I figured let's look into the data!

- There are lots of ways to cut up the data, and I decided to simply look at the proportion of minutes played by international/American players stratified by listed position. I may break it down by heights later, but for now, this is the easiest data to work with. 
- I know that positionless basketball is popular and what a player is listed as doesn't always reflect their role on the court, or their size, but this is a rough first look. 
- There are a handful of players who are listed at multiple positions. Although the reality doesn't reflect a basic 50-50 split of their minutes, I evenly divided their minutes up between their listed positions. 
- The criteria international/American criteria used was simply whether or not the player was born in the 50 states. So Kyrie Irving and Tim Duncan are counted as "international" despite their citizenships and upbringings. 

Special shoutout to [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/) (SR), specifically [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) (BR), for all of the data on the players' minutes played, positions, and birth places.
